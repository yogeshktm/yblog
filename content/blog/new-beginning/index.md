> “It is never too late to be what you might have been.” —George Eliot

It is very hard to start something new even it is the thing you love most. But i have started now A blog dedicated to document my learnings in web design,javascript and life

Web designing is my passion and profession since 2013.I have handcrafted lot of websites in these 6 years. But starting a simple website as a blog and portfolio become nighmare for me.

I have developed various layouts for my new website, Bought a different domain name every year, Looking for the cool brand name and nothing works so far. Finally i stopped thinking too much and started a simple blog with standard theme and some css tinkering for my satisfaction. thats it MY BLOG is live now and you are reading my first post.

If you are sailing on the same boat like me thinking too much and doing nothing. I would suggest "Stop Thinking ! Start Doing".

What you can expect from this blog ?

You may expect posts atleast 1 post per week on web design, javascript, react.
