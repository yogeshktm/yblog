It is very hard to start something new even it is the thing you love most. Web designing is my passion and profession since 2013. But lauching a simple personal website/blog for me become a nightmare. Why ?

**Thinking too much.🤔**

I have developed various layouts for my new website, Bought a different domain name every year, Looking for the cool brand name and nothing works so far.Over thinking paralyzed my brain 🤯.So Finally stopped thinking  and started a simple blog with standard theme and some css tinkering for my satisfaction. thats it MY BLOG is live now and you are reading my first post 👏👏👏.

Blogging is not new to me. I can proudly say i am a Tamil blogger running a blog called <a href="http://jillthanni.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Jillthanni</a>.Even though it is full of my bla bla thought and memories i can carry through the little experience to run this a new.

I have planned to use this blog as a materialistic partner to document my learnings in Web design,css and whatever in front end development.

Since this is my first post i have to short introduce myself.

Yogeshwaran - Weaving web since 2013 - Coffee addict - Adorable husband to a beautiful wife - Occasional book worm.  

See you soon in upcoming posts.
